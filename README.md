## The Brief  

At the School of Code, our goal was to create anything we envisioned within the short timeframe of one week. This project encompassed everything we had learned, ensuring that we utilised only the necessary tools and techniques to solve the problem effectively.

## Documentation 

<h3><u>App Outline</u></h3>  
Our app tackles three barriers that prevent people getting out for a walk:

-  In the UK it can be hard to find a window of nice weather.    
-  People can’t think of where to go.   
-  Life and lethargy get in the way. Our app tells people WHEN to walk, WHERE to walk, and WHY to walk.    
   
Our WHEN solution uses a weather API to find the best one hour window on each of the next three days. Our WHERE solution pulls local green spaces from google and presents appealing photos which can be clicked on to get directions from where you are now. Our WHY solution offers pithy motivational reminders and busts excuses. The app is a progressive web app so for easy access from your phone that provides geo-relevant information.  

<h3><u>Mobile First</u></h3> 
With an focus for getting our users to venture into regular, refreshing walks into local perhaps unknown vistas or natural points of interest, naturally our app made sense to execute in a mobile first approach:
